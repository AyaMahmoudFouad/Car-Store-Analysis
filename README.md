About the project

 ÔÅµ This is the Car sales data set which include information about different cars . This 
data set is being taken from the Analytixlabs for the purpose of prediction
 In this we have to see two things
 First, we have seen which feature has more impact on car sales and carry out 
result of this
 Secondly, we have to train the classifier and to predict car sales and check the 
accuracy of the prediction.
When analyzing data for the car business, key insights often revolve around understanding 
customer preferences, market trends, operational efficiency, and profitability. Here are 
some of the most valuable insights you can derive from automotive data:
 1. *CUSTOMER PREFERENCES & BUYING BEHAVIOR*
 2. *MARKET TRENDS*- *VEHICLE TYPE PREFERENCE*: ANALYZE TRENDS IN PREFERENCES FOR SUVS, SEDANS, TRUCKS, ELECTRIC 
VEHICLES (EVS), AND HYBRIDS. UNDERSTANDING WHICH MODELS OR SEGMENTS ARE GAINING POPULARITY 
CAN GUIDE INVENTORY AND MARKETING STRATEGIES.- *PRICE SENSITIVITY*: IDENTIFY HOW PRICE CHANGES IMPACT DEMAND. SEGMENT CUSTOMERS BY 
BUDGET TO TARGET PRICING STRATEGIES MORE EFFECTIVELY.- BRAND LOYALTY & SWITCHING*: INVESTIGATING CUSTOMER RETENTION RATES, BRAND LOYALTY, AND 
REASONS FOR SWITCHING BRANDS (E.G., RELIABILITY, COST OF OWNERSHIP, TECHNOLOGY) CAN HELP 
IMPROVE LONG-TERM CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT.
3. *Technological Advancements*- *Connected Car Features*: The rise of in-car technology (e.g., infotainment systems, autonomous 
driving, connected car services) is shaping customer preferences. Tracking which features are most 
desired helps refine product offerings and marketing strategies.- *Autonomous & Semi-Autonomous Driving*: Analyzing the readiness of the market for autonomous 
features, consumer trust in these technologies, and regulatory developments is crucial for future 
planning.
 4. *Competitive Benchmarking*- *Competitor Analysis*: Compare performance with competitors in terms of sales, customer 
satisfaction, and market share. Understanding competitor pricing, product offerings, and marketing 
strategies helps identify opportunities and threats.- *New Entrants (EV-focused companies) *: Companies like Tesla have disrupted the market. Keeping 
track of new entrants, especially in the EV sector, and how they are shaping customer preferences is key 
to staying competitive.
